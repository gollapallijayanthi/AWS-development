Here’s what I worked on:

🖥 Launched two VMs – one with Ubuntu and one with Windows Server 2022

🌐 Assigned static public IPs so both VMs are accessible anytime

🔒 Enabled termination protection to avoid accidental deletion

📡 Allowed ping and web traffic for easy testing and website access

🌍 Deployed sample websites using NGINX (Ubuntu) and IIS (Windows)

💾 Attached 5GB volumes, formatted them (ext4 for Linux, K drive for Windows)

📸 Took snapshots for backup

📦 Created custom AMIs (dr7-linx & dr7-win) for recovery and reuse


This project helped me understand how to set up and manage cloud servers end-to-end — from security to storage to deployment.
